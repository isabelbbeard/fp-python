Somewhat disagree,Disagree,Somewhat agree,Agree,Agree,The dashed line makes it look like a minus. The pink circle is confusing - what is the size mean? What is the color?

Brand with hyphen in the search makes it confusing in the results where the brand is. the -/+ price is really small (could also relate color to 'moderate risk').

Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Strongly agree,User rating looks like a minus sign. Maybe move the big bubble to the top of the user rating key (5-1).

Somewhat agree,Agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,The price is confusing - didn't understand that all the information related to the chosen product. Using pink is confusing because it also tied into the key but used in the 'chosen product'. The emphasis on the arrow doesn't help. Categories if they popped a bit more. Confused the relationship between '% low risk' and the rating to the circle. What is in black and what is in green is confusing.

Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Confused about the categories because they aren't colored - they are kind of in the foreground in terms of styling.
